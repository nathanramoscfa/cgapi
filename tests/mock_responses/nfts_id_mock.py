    "description": "<h3>What Is the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bored Ape Yacht Club is a "
                   "collection of 10,000 unique Bored Ape NFTs, which showcase a series of apes with different "
                   "characteristics and expressions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Often the face of NFTs, the BAYC collection is one "
                   "of the most well-known NFT collections, with many celebrities holding the collection. Some of "
                   "these celebrities include Justin Bieber, Eminem, Serena Williams, Stephen Curry, "
                   "Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal, and Jimmy Fallon. Celebrities and investors were not the only ones "
                   "interested in the collection, even big corporate companies like Adidas purchased their own "
                   "Ape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Launched in April 2021, the project was available for mint at 0.08 ETH and was "
                   "sold out within 12 hours. Less than 2 years later, "
                   "the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/10-most-expensive-nfts-ever-sold\" "
                   "target=\"_blank\">most expensive ape</a> was sold at an astounding 3.4 Million "
                   "USD.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Who Is the Team Behind BAYC?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The NFT project was created by "
                   "Yuga Labs, a team of four individuals who preferred to use their online pseudonyms and only later "
                   "revealed their identities to the public. The team consists of Greg Solana (<a "

                   "target=\"_blank\">Seneca</a>, Thomas Dagley, Migwashere, and other artists who, to this day, "
                   "choose to remain anonymous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2022, the team behind BAYC, Yuga Labs, also acquired "
                   "2 popular NFT collections &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/cryptopunks\" "

                   "space.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What Is the Utility of the BAYC Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Being a holder "
                   "of the BAYC collection doubles as a membership card and grants exclusive access to holders. "
                   "Holding an Ape also allows the owners commercial and branding rights to their "
                   "NFTs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BAYC holders are granted exclusive access to &lsquo;THE BATHROOM&rsquo; and a "
                   "private Discord server. &lsquo;THE BATHROOM&rsquo; is a collaborative community board where "
                   "holders are able to draw pixels at intervals of 15 minutes. The Discord server allows BAYC "
                   "holders to interact with other holders and get access to new features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BAYC holders "
                   "are also granted access to the Yuga Lab&rsquo;s projects. This will include other NFT collections "
                   "and the BAYC metaverse (Otherside).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Bored Ape Yacht Club "

                   "ecosystem</a>, the team also launched its own native token, "

                   "several spin-off NFT collections, and its own <a "

                   "target=\"_blank\">metaverse</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Launched in March 2022, Yuga Labs released their "
                   "native token APE, which functions as a governance token. This ERC-20 token APE allows holders to "
                   "execute transactions, make governing decisions, and participate in the ecosystem. During the "
                   "launch, a portion of the token supply was airdropped to BAYC and MAYC owners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yuga "
                   "Labs also launched spin-off collections such as the <a "

                   "target=\"_blank\">Bored Ape Kennel Club</a> (BAKC). In August 2021, Yuga Labs airdropped BAYC "
                   "holders a &ldquo;mutant serum&rdquo;. With the serum, BAYC holders were able to mutate or mint "
                   "their own Bored Ape into a Mutant Ape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In July 2021, BAYC holders were airdropped "
                   "the BAKC collection. The BAKC collection functions as a companion collection in a bid to reward "
                   "BAYC holders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The BAYC ecosystem also consists of the <a "

                   "Metaverse</a>. While the metaverse is still currently under development, when completed, "
                   "the metaverse will be a virtual world where their NFTs can be used as playable "
                   "characters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In September 2023, Yuga Labs announced the launch of a new game, "
                   "Legend of the Mara (LotM), a collection-based 2D strategy game. The game is a sub-universe within "
                   "the broader Otherside metaverse game.</p>\r\n",
